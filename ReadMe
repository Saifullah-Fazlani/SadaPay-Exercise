Following assumptions have been made while development of this project.

1. Minimum iOS support is set to 13.0
2. In order to see current data, user would need to use "Pull to refresh" functionality.
3. Retry animation would be displayed when:
	i. API is unreachable
	ii. API returns erroneous data
	iii. Network is unreachable
4. Dark mode functionality follows system settings for user interface.

Also, Git history has been attached.
